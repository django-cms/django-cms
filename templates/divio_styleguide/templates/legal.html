That is the case regardless of what forms the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio, or code. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr">the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;</p>

			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr">the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr">the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr">your Website is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other web sites or blogs, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr">your Website is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example, your Website’s URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own; and</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr">you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by Divio or otherwise.<br>
			<br>
			&#8203;By submitting Content to Divio for inclusion on your Website, you grant Divio a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your Website. If you delete Content, Divio will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Divio has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Divio’s sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Divio’s reasonable opinion, violates any Divio policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in Divio’s sole discretion. Divio will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Advertisements.</strong> Divio reserves the right to display advertisements on your Website unless you have purchased an Ad-free Upgrade or a Paid Services account.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Payment and Renewal.</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr"><strong>General Terms.</strong> Optional paid services such as extra storage, domain purchases, additional features or paid hosting are available on the Website (any such services, an “Upgrade”). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Divio the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service (additional payment terms specifically for Paid Services are described below). Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> Unless you notify Divio before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be cancelled at any time in the Upgrades section of your site’s dashboard.</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paid Services.</strong></p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fees.</strong>&nbsp;Payment. By signing up for a Paid Services account you agree to pay Divio the setup fees and monthly hosting fees indicated in exchange for the services listed. Applicable fees will be invoiced starting from the day your Paid Services are established and in advance of using such services. Divio reserves the right to change the payment terms and fees upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to you. Paid Services can be cancelled by you at anytime on 30 days written notice to Divio.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.6;"><strong>Support.</strong> Some Paid Services include access to priority email support. “Email support” means the ability to make requests for technical support assistance by email at any time (with reasonable efforts by Divio to respond within one business day) concerning the use of the Paid Services. “Priority” means that support for Paid Services customers takes priority over support for users of the standard, free Divio services. All Paid Services support will be provided in accordance with Divio standard Paid Services practices, procedures and policies.</span></p>

	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Enterprise / Training / Dedicated Team / Custom Development / Migration</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>General.</strong> Deviations from the Terms of Service - in particular relating to the validity of client purchasing conditions - require explicit written confirmation of their validity from Divio.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Order Placement and Execution. </strong>The prices specified in the offers are estimates based on current knowledge and comparable projects. They are neither fixed rates nor binding cost information in the sense of Art. 373 of Swiss Code of Obligations (“OR”). Offers made by Divio are non-binding until Divio confirms them in a written order confirmation or by both parties in an appropriate contract.<br>
		The order is executed in accordance with the information specified in the binding offer or contract. Divio is obliged to execute the order with care and to protect the industrial and business confidentiality of the client. Divio reserves the right to bring in third parties to fulfil the contract if necessary.<br>
		Unless agreed otherwise, Divio will bill his services according to the effective costs. This also applies to the budget listed in the offer, which represents a non-binding approximate price.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Prices, Special Services, Additional and Travel Expenses. </strong>The offer and order confirmation assume that the order is carried out without any problems. Extraordinary overheads and special services that have not been explicitly offered and agreed, for example training, the expansion of the scope of function, provision of material, etc. are billed at an additional CHF 200.00/hr (excl. 8% VAT) or equivalent. Unless specified otherwise, meetings are billed at CHF 200.00/hr (excl. 8% VAT) or equivalent per person based on the number of hours. Internal material used is also calculated separately (colour printouts, CDs, data transmission, photos, etc.).<br>
		Courier costs and expenses for travel made in connection with the order and discussed with the client should be reimbursed by the client.<br>
		Expenditure for additional costs, in particular special materials for the creation of models, photos, reproduction costs, setting and printing, translations, etc., are to be reimbursed by the client. Unless specified or discussed otherwise, all content should be provided by the client.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Standard Service Times.</strong> The standard service times are business days 09:00-18:00 CET/CEST. Services provided after 18.00 are billed with a 25% surcharge. The surcharge is applied if the client explicitly requires the work to be completed outside of standard service times. Overtime quotas must be explicitly approved by the client. Services on public holidays, Saturdays and Sundays are billed with a 50% surcharge.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Payment.&nbsp;</strong>Unless agreed otherwise, the invoice for the first month has to be pre-paid when the order is placed. Divio is entitled to commence with the order only when the advance payment is paid in full. Unless agreed otherwise, subsequent invoices are sent each month. The invoice must be paid within 10 days. Invoices for Enterprise- and Training Services have to be paid full in advance.<br>
		A reduction of the contract fee is only possible in the case of objective breaches of the contract and not for artistic or design-related reasons. In particular, dissatisfaction and aesthetic non-compliance with the service provided by Divio do not exempt the client from the payment liability. If there are indications that the services of Divio do not fully correspond to the requirements and perceptions of the client, the client must inform Divio of this immediately. Until this notification is received, the expenses incurred by Divio are considered to be accepted.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Delivery Period.</strong> All dates and delivery periods specified by Divio are only approximate without another explicit written agreement and are therefore considered to be non-binding. Even when binding date agreements have been made, if the delivery is delayed, the obligation to provide compensation only exists in the case of intention and gross negligence by Divio. Inevitable or unforeseeable events and, in particular, delays on the part of the client, release Divio from compliance with the agreed dates.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Acceptance. </strong>After notification of the creation of the order and the invitation to acceptance by Divio, acceptance must be given within one month. Late acceptance entitles Divio to submit an additional invoice. If the client refuses to accept, Divio can grant an additional period of 14 days for mutual acceptance. If this additional period is not used, the order is considered to be accepted.<br>
		In the case of defects identified during acceptance, the client only has a right to improvement or additional delivery within two months. The notice of defects must be brought within 10 days. After this time, the contract is considered to be approved. The improvement of basic defects requires another acceptance.<br>
		The contractor retains the right to send the final invoice if the project delays are not their fault. The contractor also retains this right if the project cannot be placed online for end-users through no fault of their own.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reference and Note. </strong>Divio is entitled to cite orders and their results for reference purposes and to include comments and/or links to Divio on the work produced.</p>
		</li>

	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Changes.</strong> We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose. Your continued use of or access to the Website following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. Divio may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Termination. </strong>For services as specified in section 1, Divio may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a Paid Services account, such account can only be terminated by Divio if you materially breach this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days from Divio’s notice to you thereof; provided that, Divio can terminate the Website immediately as part of a general shut down of our service. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

	<p dir="ltr"><strong>Limitation of Liability. </strong>In no event will Divio, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to Divio under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. Divio shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Data Processing Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;If you are a subscriber to the Service, to the extent that Divio&nbsp;processes any Personal Information (as defined in the DPA)&nbsp;that is subject to the GDPR (as defined in the DPA), on your behalf, in the provision of the Service, the terms of the <a href="/en/terms-and-policies/data-processing-agreement/">data processing agreement</a>, which are hereby incorporated by reference, shall apply and the parties agree to comply with such terms.
