Documentation
=============

In order to work with django CMS, ``index.html`` has been renamed to
``base.html`` and assets have been moved to the ``static/`` directory.

Files that are detected within the root of a website such as ``humans.txt`` or
``crossdomain.xml`` are currently not supported by Divio Cloud.

Please refer to our `Quickstart Guides <http://support.divio.com/control-panel/boilerplates/>`_
for further help on boilerplates.
