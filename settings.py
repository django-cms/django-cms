# This is a fairly standard Django settings file, with some special additions
# that allow addon applications to auto-configure themselves. If it looks
# unfamiliar, please see our documentation:
#
#   http://docs.divio.com/en/latest/reference/configuration-settings-file.html
#
# and comments below.


# INSTALLED_ADDONS is a list of self-configuring Divio Cloud addons - see the
# Addons view in your project's dashboard. See also the addons directory in
# this project, and the INSTALLED_ADDONS section in requirements.in.

INSTALLED_ADDONS = [
    # Important: Items listed inside the next block are auto-generated.
    # Manual changes will be overwritten.
    # <INSTALLED_ADDONS>
    "aldryn-addons",
    "aldryn-django",
    # </INSTALLED_ADDONS>
]

# Now we will load auto-configured settings for addons. See:
#
#   http://docs.divio.com/en/latest/reference/configuration-aldryn-config.html
#
# for information about how this works.
#
# Note that any settings you provide before the next two lines are liable to be
# overwritten, so they should be placed *after* this section.

import aldryn_addons.settings

aldryn_addons.settings.load(locals())

# Your own Django settings can be applied from here on. Key settings like
# INSTALLED_APPS, MIDDLEWARE and TEMPLATES are provided in the Aldryn Django
# addon. See:
#
#   http://docs.divio.com/en/latest/how-to/configure-settings.html
#
# for guidance on managing these settings.

INSTALLED_APPS.extend(
    [
        # Extend the INSTALLED_APPS setting by listing additional applications here
    ]
)

# To see the settings that have been applied, use the Django diffsettings
# management command.
