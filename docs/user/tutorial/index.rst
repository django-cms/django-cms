.. note:: This is a new section in the django CMS documentation, and a priority
          for the project. If you'd like to contribute to it, we'd love to hear
          from you - join us on the #django-cms IRC channel on `freenode`_ or
          the `django-cms-developers`_ email list.

It's strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial step-by-step. It has
been designed to introduce you to the system in a methodical way, and each
step builds on the previous one.
