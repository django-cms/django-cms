.. _user-tutorial:

The tutorial project is available in three different ways.

If you're new to django CMS and want to get started immediately, simply `sign up for a tutorial
site <http://django-cms.org/tutorial-site>`_. This option is the easiest and will get you started
in a few clicks of the mouse, and is strongly recommended for those new to the platform. It will
create an account for you and automatically launch your own copy of the tutorial site. (If you
already have an Aldryn account, it will create and deploy the site there.)

You don't have to run the tutorial on Aldryn - if you have some technical knowledge you can also
choose to :ref:`use a Docker image of the tutorial site <tutorial-docker>`, or :ref:`use the
tutorial site from GitHub <tutorial-github>`.

Whichever way you launch the tutorial site, once you have it running, you can move onto the first
step and :ref:`log in to your site <cms_login>`.

It's strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial step-by-step. It has been designed to
introduce you to the system in a methodical way, and each step builds on the previous one.
