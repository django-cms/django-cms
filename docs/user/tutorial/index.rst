Tutorial

.. note:: This is a new section in the django CMS documentation, and a priority
          for the project. If you'd like to contribute to it, we'd love to hear
          from you - join us on the #django-cms IRC channel on `freenode`_ or
          the `django-cms-developers`_ email list.

It's strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial step-by-step. It has
been designed to introduce you to the system in a methodical way, and each
step builds on the previous one.

In the tutorial you'll build a website for a bicycle repair service, using a full range of django
CMS functionality. You'll also learn how to manage information about such things as events, people,
news, jobs and more, all using dedicated applications that have been designed to integrate with
django CMS.

.. note:: **Touch-screen users**

    django CMS supports touch-screen interfaces, though there are currently some limitations in
    support. You will be able to complete the tutorial using a touch-screen device, but please
    consult :ref:`touch`, and see the notes on :ref:`device-support`.
