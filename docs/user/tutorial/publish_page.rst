Publish a page
##############

Your page is a *draft* - only you and other users with permission to edit the page can see it. To
publish it so that ordinary web visitors can see, hit **Publish changes**.

You'll notice that the toolbar indicates you're now seeing a *Live* view of
your page. If you want to make further changes:

* switch back to *Draft* mode, by using the :ref:`Draft/live switch
  <publishing-controller>`
* make further changes in *Structure* or *Content* mode using the
  :ref:`Structure/Content button <structure-content-button>`
* **Publish changes** when you're ready, using *Page > Publish page* from the
  toolbar, or the *language version* control in the :ref:`page-list`

Until you publish your changes, you can continue working on the draft without
affecting the published page.

You have now worked through the complete cycle of content publishing in django
CMS.
