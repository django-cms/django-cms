********************
Create the home page
********************

Because this is a brand new site, when you visit it as a site administrator, django CMS's *Create
Page wizard* will open a new dialog box.

Select *Next*, and provide a *Title* and some basic text content for the new page (you'll be
able to add formatting to this text in a moment), then hit **Create**.

    Title
        City Bicycle Services

    Content
        We're proud to be the first and best 24-hour bicycle repair service in the city. Whatever
        your bicycle repair needs, you can rely on us to provide a top-quality service at very
        reasonable prices. We also operate a unique call-out service to come to the aid of stranded
        cyclists. No job's too small or too large, and we can repair anything from a puncture to a
        cracked frame.

==========
Publishing
==========

Your newly-created page is just a *draft*, and won't actually be published until you decide. As an
editor, you can see drafts, but other visitors to your site will only see published pages. Hit
|publish-page-now| to publish it.

Further editing
===============

.. |edit| image:: /user/tutorial/images/edit-button.png
   :alt: 'Edit'

.. |view-published| image:: /user/tutorial/images/view-published.png
   :alt: 'View published'

At any time, you can make further changes to a page, by switching back into Edit mode, using the
|edit| button that appears, and return to the *published* version of the page using the
|view-published| button.

In editing mode, double-click (if you're using a pointer) or tap (if you're using a touch screen)
on the paragraph of text to change it. This will open the Text plugin containing it. Make changes -
perhaps break the text into paragraphs - and **Save** it again.

.. note::

    The editor in this project is the *CKEditor*. It's powerful and has numerous features that will
    probably be fairly familiar. Feel free to explore, but don't worry, we'll come back to look at
    the more important ones soon.

You can continue making and previewing changes privately until you are ready to publish them.

Create a contact page
*********************

Now we should create a second page, with contact information, so that customers can find our
workshop.

At the top of your page is the django CMS *toolbar*, with various useful tools in it.

Hit |create| to create a second page. This opens the *Create page* wizard:

Select **New Page**, then **Next**, and once again, give the page a *Title* and some basic text
content, then **Publish** it as you did previously.
