Development of django CMS
#########################

django CMS is an open-source project, and relies on its community of users to
keep getting better.

You don't need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all
you need is a little knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the
contribution guidelines.

Remember that contributions to the documentation are highly prized, and key to
the success of the django CMS project.

Development is led by a team of **core developers**, and under the overall
guidance of a **technical board**.

All activity in the community is governed by our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.

*************
Branch policy
*************

* **master**: this is the current stable release, the version released on PyPI.
* **support/3.0.x**: this will be our *next stable release*; this is the most
  appropriate branch for fixes and patches that will go into the next **master**
* **develop**: this will be *django CMS 3.1*; this is the most appropriate
  branch for more substantial features that will need team co-ordination

If in doubt, ask on the #django-cms IRC channel on `freenode`_ or the
`django-cms-developers`_ email list!
