django CMS is an open-source project, and relies on its community of users to
keep getting better.

Community
*********

You can join us online:

* in our IRC channel, #django-cms, on ``irc.freenode.net``. If you don't have an IRC client, you can
  `join our IRC channel using the KiwiIRC web client
  <https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/django-cms>`_, which works pretty well.
* on our `django CMS users email list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-cms>`_ for
  **general** django CMS questions and discussion
* on our `django CMS developers email list
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/django-cms-developers>`_ for discussions about the
  **development of django CMS**

You can also follow:

* the `Travis Continuous Integration build reports <https://travis-ci.org/divio/django-cms>`_
* the `@djangocms`_ Twitter account for general announcements

You don't need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all
you need is a little knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the
contribution guidelines.

Remember that contributions to the documentation are highly prized, and key to
the success of the django CMS project.

Development is led by a team of **core developers**, and under the overall
guidance of a **technical board**.

All activity in the community is governed by our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.


***************
Security issues
***************

.. ATTENTION::

    If you think you have discovered a security issue in our code, please report
    it **privately**, by emailing us at `security@django-cms.org`_.

        Please **do not** raise it on:

        * IRC
        * GitHub
        * either of our email lists

        or in any other public forum until we have had a chance to deal with it.


*************************
Release schedule & policy
*************************

The roadmap <https://github.com/divio/django-cms/wiki/Roadmap>`_ can be found on our GitHub wiki
page.

We are planning releases according to **key principles and aims**. Issues within milestones are
therefore subject to change.

The `django-cms-developers`_ group serves as gathering point for developers. We submit
ideas and proposals prior to the roadmap goals.

We officially support the **current** and **previous** released versions of django CMS. Older
versions are maintained through the community. Divio provides long term support (LTS) through
`commercial support <http://divio.ch/en/commercial-support/>`_.


*************
Branch policy
*************

* **master**: this is the current stable release, the version released on PyPI.
* **support/3.2.x**: this will be our *next stable release*; this is the most
  appropriate branch for fixes and patches that will go into the next **master**
* **develop**: this will be *django CMS 3.3*; this is the most appropriate
  branch for more substantial features that will need team co-ordination

If in doubt, ask on the #django-cms IRC channel on `freenode`_ or the
`django-cms-developers`_ email list!
