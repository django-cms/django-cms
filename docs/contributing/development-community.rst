Contribute to django CMS
========================

As an open source project, django CMS is only as strong as its community. Without the
donation of time and skill of our contributors and the financial support of our
`association members <https://www.django-cms.org/en/our-members/>`_ it would not be
possible to maintain the django CMS project. The community is the backbone of django
CMS.

Our contributors come from all over the world and have different levels of skills and
expertise. No matter if you are a developer, usability enthusiast, designer or
copywriter. Young or old. Experienced or inexperienced. Every contribution, however
small, is valued.

You donâ€™t need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all you need
is a little knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the contribution
guidelines.

Open source contribution can include taking part in discussions, filing bug reports,
proposing improvements, contributing code or writing documentation.

Remember that contributions to the documentation are highly prized, and key to the
success of the django CMS project.

All activity in the community is governed by our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.

3 Reasons Why You Should Contribute
-----------------------------------

1. Boost your reputation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Through your involvement as a contributor, other people become aware of your work. In
this way, you make a name for yourself in the community and your reputation grows. This
can also help you in your professional career. Add your contribution to your resume or
LinkedIn profile.

2. Find a mentor and improve your skills
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you join a workgroup, you will receive guidance and support from the workgroup
leader. Our working group leaders are professionals in their field and often in leading
positions in their respective companies. Take advantage of this unique opportunity for
personal development!

3. Meet new people and increase your network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's face it: Ultimately, it's the people who bring the django CMS project to life and
fill it with joy. Through your involvement, you'll meet new people and maybe even make
new friends. As a community, it's important to us to create a pleasant atmosphere where
everyone feels welcome!

Are you new to django CMS?
--------------------------

If you are new to django CMS, then we recommend you to first familiarize yourself with
the CMS and start with the `install
<https://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/introduction/01-install.html>`_ section. After
that, you can have a go at issues on Github that are marked `Good first issue
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms/labels/good%20first%20issues>`_. These issues
are especially good if you're just starting out but still want to contribute.
