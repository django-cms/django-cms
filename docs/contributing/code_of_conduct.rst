Code of Conduct
===============

Participation in the django CMS project is governed by a code of conduct.

The django CMS community is a pleasant one to be involved in for everyone, and we wish
to keep it that way. Participants are expected to behave and communicate with others
courteously and respectfully, whether online or in person, and to be welcoming, friendly
and polite.

We will not tolerate abusive behaviour or language or any form of harassment.

Individuals whose behaviour is a cause for concern will be given a warning, and if
necessary will be excluded from participation in official django CMS channels and events. The `Django Software Foundation
<http://djangoproject.com/foundation/>`_ will also be informed of the issue.

Raising a concern
-----------------

If you have a concern about the behaviour of any member of the django CMS community,
please contact us via info@django-cms.org and our Community Manager will reach out to
you.

Your concerns will be taken seriously, treated as confidential and investigated. You
will be informed, in writing and as promptly as possible, of the outcome.
