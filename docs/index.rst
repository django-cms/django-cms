django CMS documentation
========================


Welcome to the **django CMS** developer documentation.

django CMS is a modern, open-source content management system built on Django,
designed to solve complex publishing requirements using simple, composable parts.

This documentation is organised using the **Diátaxis framework**, which separates
learning material, practical guides, conceptual explanations, and technical
reference — so you can quickly find the information you need.

If you are looking for editor or administrator documentation, see the
`django CMS User Guide <https://user-guide.django-cms.org/>`_.

✨ Why django CMS?
-----------------

django CMS is a mature, open-source content management system built on
Django. It is designed for projects that require flexibility, long-term
stability, and close integration with custom Django applications.

Key features include:

- robust internationalisation (i18n) and multi-site support
- front-end (and inline) editing that allows editors to work directly on
  rendered pages
- a flexible placeholder and plugin system for composing reusable
  content components
- integration with multiple rich-text editors
- support for content versioning, editorial workflows, and headless setups through
  official add-on packages

Compared to other Django-based CMS platforms, django CMS stands out for:

- a small, stable core that integrates cleanly into existing Django
  projects
- non-monolithic architecture that allows incremental adoption
- thorough, structured documentation organised using the Diátaxis
  framework
- an active, long-running open-source community
- an emphasis on code quality, testing, and long-term support
