How the menu system works
=========================

Basic concepts
--------------

.. _soft-root:

Soft Roots
~~~~~~~~~~

A *soft root* is a page that acts as the root for a menu navigation tree.

Typically, this will be a page that is the root of a significant new section on your
site.

When the *soft root* feature is enabled, the navigation menu for any page will start at
the nearest *soft root*, rather than at the real root of the site's page hierarchy.

This feature is useful when your site has deep page hierarchies (and therefore multiple
levels in its navigation trees). In such a case, you usually don't want to present site
visitors with deep menus of nested items.

For example, you're on the page "Introduction to Bleeding", so the menu might look like
this:

.. code-block::

    School of Medicine
        Medical Education
        Departments
            Department of Lorem Ipsum
            Department of Donec Imperdiet
            Department of Cras Eros
            Department of Mediaeval Surgery
                Theory
                Cures
                    Bleeding
                        * Introduction to Bleeding <current page>
                        Bleeding - the scientific evidence
                        Cleaning up the mess
                    Cupping
                    Leaches
                    Maggots
                Techniques
                Instruments
            Department of Curabitur a Purus
            Department of Sed Accumsan
            Department of Etiam
        Research
        Administration
        Contact us
        Impressum

which is frankly overwhelming.

By making "Department of Mediaeval Surgery" a *soft root*, the menu becomes much more
manageable:

.. code-block::

    Department of Mediaeval Surgery
        Theory
        Cures
            Bleeding
                * Introduction to Bleeding <current page>
                Bleeding - the scientific evidence
                Cleaning up the mess
            Cupping
            Leaches
            Maggots
        Techniques
        Instruments

Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The menu system isn't monolithic. Rather, it is composed of numerous active parts, many
of which can operate independently of each other.

What they operate on is a list of menu nodes, that gets passed around the menu system,
until it emerges at the other end.

The main active parts of the menu system are menu *generators* and *modifiers*.

Some of these parts are supplied with the ``"menus"`` application. Some come from other
applications (from the ``"cms"`` application in django CMS, for example, or some other
application entirely).

All these active parts need to be registered within the menu system.

Then, when the time comes to build a menu, the system will ask all the registered menu
generators and modifiers to get to work on it.

Generators and Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Menu generators and modifiers are classes.

Generators
++++++++++

To add nodes to a menu a generator is required.

There is one in cms for example, which examines the Pages in the database and adds them
as nodes.

These classes are sub-classes of :py:class:`menus.base.Menu`. The one in cms is
:py:class:`cms.menu.CMSMenu`.

In order to use a generator, its :py:meth:`~menus.base.Menu.get_nodes()` method must be
called.

Modifiers
+++++++++

A modifier examines the nodes that have been assembled, and modifies them according to
its requirements (adding or removing them, or manipulating their attributes, as it sees
fit).

An important one in cms (:py:class:`cms.menu.SoftRootCutter`) removes the nodes that are
no longer required when a soft root is encountered.

These classes are sub-classes of :py:class:`menus.base.Modifier`. Examples are
:py:class:`cms.menu.NavExtender` and :py:class:`cms.menu.SoftRootCutter`.

In order to use a modifier, its :py:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify()` method must be
called.

Note that each Modifier's :py:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify()` method can be called
*twice*, before and after the menu has been trimmed.

For example when using the ``{% show_menu %}`` template tag, it's called:

- first, by :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.get_nodes()`, with the argument
  ``post_cut = False``
- later, by the template tag, with the argument ``post_cut = True``

This corresponds to the state of the nodes list before and after
:py:func:`menus.templatetags.menu_tags.cut_levels()`, which removes nodes from the menu
according to the arguments provided by the template tag.

This is because some modification might be required on *all* nodes, and some might only
be required on the subset of nodes left after cutting.

Nodes
~~~~~

Nodes are assembled in a tree. Each node is an instance of the
:class:`menus.base.NavigationNode` class.

A NavigationNode has attributes such as URL, title, parent and children - as one would
expect in a navigation tree.

It also has an ``attr`` attribute, a dictionary that's provided for you to add arbitrary
attributes to, rather than placing them directly on the node itself, where they might
clash with something.

.. warning::

    You can't assume that a :py:class:`menus.base.NavigationNode` represents a django
    CMS Page. Firstly, some nodes may represent objects from other applications.
    Secondly, you can't expect to be able to access Page objects via NavigationNodes. To
    check if node represents a CMS Page, check for ``is_page`` in
    :py:attr:`menus.base.NavigationNode.attr` and that it is ``True``.

Menu system logic
-----------------

Let's look at an example using the ``{% show_menu %}`` template tag. It will be
different for other template tags, and your applications might have their own menu
classes. But this should help explain what's going on and what the menu system is doing.

One thing to understand is that the system passes around a list of ``nodes``, doing
various things to it.

Many of the methods below pass this list of nodes to the ones it calls, and return them
to the ones that they were in turn called by.

The ``ShowMenu.get_context()`` method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the Django template engine encounters the ``{% show_menu %}`` template tag, it
calls the :py:meth:`get_context() <menus.templatetags.menu_tags.ShowMenu.get_context()>`
of the ``ShowMenu`` class. ``get_context()``:

- calls :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.get_nodes()` (see :ref:`get_nodes_method`
  below)
- cuts any nodes other than its descendants (if a ``root_id`` has been provided)
- calls :py:meth:`menus.templatetags.menu_tags.cut_levels()` to remove unwanted levels
- calls :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.apply_modifiers()` with ``post_cut = True``
- return the nodes to the context in the variable ``children``

.. _get_nodes_method:

The ``MenuPool.get_nodes()`` method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.get_nodes()` calls three other methods of
``MenuPool`` in turn:

- :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.discover_menus()`

  Checks every application's ``cms_menus.py``, and registers:
      - Menu classes, placing them in the ``self.menus`` dict
      - Modifier classes, placing them in the self.modifiers list

- :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool._build_nodes()`

      - checks the cache to see if it should return cached nodes
      - loops over the Menus in self.menus (note: by default the only generator is
        :py:class:`cms.menu.CMSMenu`); for each:

            - calls its :py:meth:`menus.base.Menu.get_nodes()` - the menu generator
            - :py:func:`menus.menu_pool._build_nodes_inner_for_one_menu()`
            - adds all nodes into a big list

- :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool.apply_modifiers()`

      - :py:meth:`menus.menu_pool.MenuPool._mark_selected()`
      - loops over each node, comparing its URL with the request.path_info, and marks
        the best match as ``selected``
      - loops over the Modifiers (see :ref:`menu-modifiers` below) in ``self.modifiers``
        calling each one's :py:meth:`~menus.base.Modifier.modify()` with
        ``post_cut=False``.

.. _menu-modifiers:

Menu Modifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``Modifier`` manipulates menu nodes and their attributes.

The default Modifiers, in the order they are called, are:

- :py:class:`cms.cms_menus.NavExtender`
- :py:class:`cms.cms_menus.SoftRootCutter`

  If ``post_cut`` is ``True``, removes all nodes below the appropriate soft root;
  otherwise, returns immediately.

- :py:class:`menus.modifiers.Marker`

  If ``post_cut`` or ``breadcrumb`` is ``True``, returns immediately; otherwise, loops
  over all nodes; finds selected, marks its ancestors, siblings and children

- :py:class:`menus.modifiers.AuthVisibility`

  Removes nodes that require authorization to see

- :py:class:`menus.modifiers.Level`

  Loops over all nodes; for each one that is a root node (``level == 0``) passes it to:

      - :py:meth:`~menus.modifiers.Level.mark_levels()` recurses over a node's
        descendants marking their levels
