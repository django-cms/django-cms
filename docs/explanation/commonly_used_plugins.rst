Some commonly-used plugins
==========================

Please note that dozens if not hundreds of different django CMS plugins have been made
available under open-source licences. Some, like the ones on this page, are likely to be
of general interest, while others are highly specialised.

All packages officially endorsed by the `django CMS Association <https://django-cms.org/>`_
are listed in the
`django-cms/djangocms-ecosystem <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-ecosystem/blob/main/README.md>`_
repository.

Please see the `Django Packages <https://djangopackages.org/search/?q=django+cms>`_ site
for some more, or just do a web search for the functionality you seek - you'll be
surprised at the range of plugins that has been created.

django CMS Core Addons
----------------------

We maintain a set of *Core Addons* for django CMS.

You don't need to use them, and for many of them alternatives exist, but they represent
a good way to get started with a reliable project set-up. We recommend them for new
users of django CMS in particular.

You will always find a complete list of the officially endorsed core addons in the
`django CMS ecosystem <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-ecosystem>`_ github
repository.

Here's a brief overview of the current status of the core addons:

.. include :: ../autogenerate/plugins.include

We welcome feedback, documentation, patches and any other help to maintain and improve
these valuable components.

Third-party Addons
------------------

These are popular addons maintained by a third party.

.. include :: ../autogenerate/third-party.include


Deprecated Addons
-----------------

Some older plugins that you may have encountered are now deprecated and we advise
against incorporating them into new projects.

.. include :: ../autogenerate/deprecated_plugins.include

Also, all `Aldryn plugins <https://github.com/aldryn/>`_ are deprecated and archived.
