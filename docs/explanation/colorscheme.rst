Color schemes (light/dark) with django CMS
==========================================

.. important::

    These notes about the color scheme apply only to the **django CMS admin and editing
    interfaces**. The visitor-facing published site is **wholly independent** of this,
    and the responsibility of the site developer.

    The admin interfaces will only reflect the described behavior if the package
    ``djangocms-admin-style`` is installed (version 3.2 or later). If it is not
    installed, the admin interface is managed by your underlying Django installation,
    which usually uses the browser's color scheme.

Setting the color scheme
------------------------

Django CMS' default color scheme is ``"light"``. To change the color scheme use the
``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME`` setting in your project's ``setting.py``:

``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME = "light"``
    This is the default appearance and shows the interface with dark text on a white
    background.

``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME = "dark"``
    This so-called dark mode shows light text on a dark background.

``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME = "auto"``
    The auto mode chooses either light or dark color scheme based on the browser or
    operating system setting of the user.

.. hint::

    If you plan to fix the color scheme to either light or dark, add a corresponding
    ``data-theme`` attribute to the ``html`` tag in your base template, e.g.

    .. code-block::

        <html data-theme="light">

    This will pin the color scheme early when loading pages and avoid potential
    flickering if the browser preference differs from the ``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME`` setting.

.. versionchanged:: 3.11.4

    Before version 3.11.4 the color scheme was set by ``data-color-scheme``. Since
    version 3.11.4 django CMS uses ``data-theme`` just as Django since version 4.2.

.. important::

    Not all plugin admin interfaces might support a dark color scheme, especially if
    plugin forms contain custom widgets.

Toggle button for the color scheme
----------------------------------

The setting ``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME_TOGGLE`` in the project's ``settings.py`` determines if a
toggle icon (sun/moon/auto) is shown in the toolbar. It allows a user to switch their
color scheme for their session.

By default, ``CMS_COLOR_SCHEME_TOGGLE`` is set to ``True``.

Make your own admin CSS color scheme aware
------------------------------------------

Plugin forms or any admin forms use Django's admin app which itself supports light and
dark color schemes. djangocms-admin-style introduces django CMS' color scheme to the
admin app. Just as Django does, djangocms-admin-style defines CSS variables for frequent
colors.

We recommend writing at least your reusable apps in a way which allows them to respect
the color scheme with djangocms-admin-style and with Django's admin style.

Here are some recommendations for making your app work as seamlessly as possible:

- Try avoiding using ``color``, ``background-color``, or other color styles where
  possible and meaningful.
- If necessary, use as few as possible standard django CMS colors (preferably from the
  list below with plain Django fallback colors)
- Use the following pattern: ``var(--dca-color-var, var(--fallback-color-var,
  #xxxxxx))`` where ``#xxxxxx`` represents the light version of the color. This tries
  django CMS color scheme first and falls back to Django color scheme if
  djangocms-admin-style is not available.
- Avoid media queries like ``@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`` since they would
  ignore forced settings to light or dark.

The admin frontend pulls the style from django admin styles and - if present - from
djangocms-admin-style. Django itself also uses CSS variables to implement admin mode,
these can be used as dark mode-aware fall-back colors.

Here's a table of django CMS' CSS color variables and their Django fallbacks:

============================= =========== ====================== ===========
Variable name                 Color       Fallback               Color
============================= =========== ====================== ===========
``--dca-white``               ``#ffffff`` ``--body-bg``          ``#ffffff``
``--dca-gray``                ``#666``    ``--body-quiet-color`` ``#666``
``--dca-gray-lightest``       ``#f2f2f2`` ``--darkened-bg``      ``#f8f8f8``
``--dca-gray-lighter``        ``#ddd``    ``--border-color``     ``#ccc``
``--dca-gray-light``          ``#999``    ``--close-button-bg``  ``#888``
``--dca-gray-darker``         ``#454545``
``--dca-gray-darkest``        ``#333``
``--dca-gray-super-lightest`` ``#f7f7f7``
``--dca-primary``             ``#00bbff`` ``--primary``          ``#79aec8``
``--dca-black``               ``#000``    ``--body-fg``          ``#303030``
============================= =========== ====================== ===========

This leaves these recommendations for color scheme dependent colors:

.. code-block::

    white:          var(--dca-white, var(--body-bg, #fff))
    gray:           var(--dca-gray, var(--body-quiet-color, #666))
    gray-lightest:  var(--dca-gray-lightest, var(--darkened-bg, #f2f2f2))
    gray-lighter    var(--dca-gray-lighter, var(--border-color, #ddd))
    gray-light:     var(--dca-gray-lightest, var(--darkened-bg, #f2f2f2))
    gray-primary:   var(--dca-primary, var(--primary, #0bf))
    black:          var(--dca-black, var(--body-fg), #000))
