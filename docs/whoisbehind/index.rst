Who is behind django CMS
========================

django CMS was released under a BSD licence in 2009. It was created at `Divio AG
<https://www.divio.com/>`_ of Zürich, Switzerland, by `Patrick Lauber
<https://github.com/digi604/>`_, who led its development for several years.

the django CMS Association
--------------------------

In July 2020 Divio handed over the banner to the newly founded `django CMS Association
<https://www.django-cms.org/en/about-us/>`_ (dCA). Its goal is to drive the success of
django CMS, by increasing customer happiness, market share and
open-source-contributions. Divio remains thoroughly committed to django CMS as the host
of the `django CMS project website <https://www.django-cms.org/>`_ and as one of the
founding members of the dCA, next to `What <https://what.digital/>`_. and `Eliga
Services <https://eliga.services/>`_.

The dCA’s role in steering the project’s development is formalised in the `django CMS
technical committee
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms-mgmt/blob/master/tech-committee/about.md>`_,
whose members are drawn from the django CMS community and the dCA.

The dCA maintains overall control of the `django CMS repository
<https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms>`_. As the chief backer of django CMS, and in
order to ensure a consistent and long-term approach to the project, the dCA reserves the
right of final say in any decisions concerning its development.

As a non-profit organization the django CMS Association is dependent on donations to
fulfill its mission, which is based on the following three statements:

- Innovate and lead
- Foster contribution
- Drive adoption

The best way to donate is to become a member of the association and pay membership fees.
The funding is funneled back into core development and community projects.
