Welcome to django CMS 3.

The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to
django CMS. They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how
easy it is to work with django CMS as a developer who wants to customise it and
get it working according to their own requirements.

These tutorials take you step-by-step through some key aspects of this work.
They're not intended to explain the :doc:`topics in depth </topics/index>`, or
provide :doc:`reference material </reference/index>`, but they will leave you
with a good idea of what it's possible to achive in just a few steps, and how
to go about it.

The tutorials follow a logical progession and build on each other, so it's
recommended to work through them in the order presented here.

    install_from_scratch
    templates_placeholders
    plugins
    apphooks
    third_party
    toolbar
    menu

If you prefer, rather than installing django CMS from scratch, you can
:doc:`/how_to/integrate` and then follow the rest of the tutorials.

Either way, you'll be able to find support and help from the numerous friendly
members of the django CMS community, either on our `mailinglist`_ or IRC
channel ``#django-cms`` on the ``irc.freenode.net`` network.
