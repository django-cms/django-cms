Tutorials
=========

The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to django CMS.
They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how easy it is to work with
django CMS as a developer who wants to customise it and get it working according to
their own requirements.

These tutorials take you step-by-step through some key aspects of this work. They're not
intended to explain the :doc:`topics in depth </explanation/index>`, or provide
:doc:`reference material </reference/index>`, but they will leave you with a good idea
of what is possible to achieve in just a few steps, and how to go about it.

Once you're familiar with the basics presented in these tutorials, you'll find the more
in-depth coverage of the same topics in the :doc:`How-to </how_to/index>` section.

The tutorials follow a logical progression, starting from installation of django CMS and
the creation of a brand new project, and build on each other, so it's recommended to
work through them in the order presented here.

    07-menu

If you want to install django CMS into an existing project, or prefer to configure
django CMS by hand, rather than using the django CMS quistart project, see
:doc:`/introduction/01-install` and then follow the rest of the tutorials.

Either way, you'll be able to find support and help from the numerous friendly members
of the django CMS community on `our Discord server <https://discord-support-channel.django-cms.org>`_.
