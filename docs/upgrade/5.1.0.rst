5.1.0 release notes
###################

*Month day, year*

Welcome to django CMS 5.1.0!

These release notes cover the new features, as well as some backwards
incompatible changes you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from
django CMS 4.0 or earlier. We've begun the deprecation process for some
features.

See the How to upgrade to 5.1.0 to a newer version guide if you’re
updating an existing project.

*******************************
Django and Python compatibility
*******************************

django CMS supports **Django 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2**. We highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

It supports **Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14**. As for Django we highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

*******************
What's new in 5.1.0
*******************

New UI design
=============

The most prominent change in django CMS 5.1.0 is the new user interface design. While functionally
similar to the previous design, it offers a more modern and streamlined experience, better color
contrast, and more consistency between the frontend editor and Django's admin interface.

Key changes include:
* More Django-like green based color prefers-color-scheme
* Modern design with round corners and updated icons
* Improved visual hierarchy and spacing

It is active by default, but the legacy design can be re-enabled by adding the ``data-cms-theme``
attribute with the value ``4`` to the ``<html>`` tag in your templates.

More flexible site configurations
=================================

The Django admin app does not have to be available on all sites. You can now
configure which sites have access to the admin interface and still edit all sites
using the admin's frontend editing and preview endpoints. This is especially useful
if you do not want to expose the admin interface on external production sites.

You can now run multiple sites with one settings file. If you omit the ``SITE_ID`` in
your settings, django CMS will determine the current site using Django's site framework
based on the request's host header. This allows you to run multiple sites with one
instance and one settings file. Note, that apphooks must not share the same URLs in
such a scenario to avoid conflicts.

If you need more complex site determination logic, you can implement a custom
middleware that sets ``request.site`` accordingly. It will be respected by django CMS.

For a step‑by‑step guide and examples, see :doc:`../how_to/03-multi-site` (including
notes on apphook isolation and URL conflicts). For management commands that run without
an HTTP request, consult :doc:`../reference/cli` for options like ``--site`` to select the
target site context.

Model-specific plugins
======================

Plugins can now be restricted to specific models using two complementary filters:

- Plugin-level: ``CMSPluginBase.allowed_models`` — list of model identifiers
  (``"app_label.modelname"``). ``None`` = allowed everywhere; ``[]`` = nowhere.
- Model-level: ``Model.allowed_plugins`` — list of plugin class names. ``None`` = all
  plugins allowed (subject to their own ``allowed_models``); ``[]`` = none.

Both filters must pass for the frontend editor offer plugins to the users.
This is particularly useful for plugins that are bound to specific Django models and should
not be available to editors on other models - or to restrict certain models to a curated set
of plugins.

Example::

    class TextFieldPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        render_template = "forms/fields/text.html"
        allowed_models = ["my_form_app.form"]

    class Form(models.Model):
        fields = PlaceholderRelationField("fields")
        allowed_plugins = ["TextFieldPlugin"]

:ref:`plugin-model-restrictions`.

Features deprecated in 5.1.0
============================

Empty sections are to be removed before release.

Removal of deprecated functionality
===================================

API
---

``cms.api.create_title`` has been removed. Use :meth:`cms.api.create_page_content` instead.


``StaticPlaceholder``
---------------------

* ``StaticPlaceholder`` has been removed from ``cms.models`` and ``cms.admin``.
Use `static aliases <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-alias>`_ instead.

* This implies that ``cms.plugin_rendering`` does not accept static placeholders any more.

* The ``static_placeholder`` template tag has been removed.

Placeholders
------------

* ``PlaceholderField`` has been removed from ``cms.fields``. Use :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField` in conjunction with
:meth:`~cms.utils.placeholder.get_placeholder_from_slot` instead (also see :ref:`placeholders_outside_cms`).

* ``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` has been removed from ``cms.admin``. It is not needed anymore and can be safely removed from your code.

* A placeholder's ``actions`` property (deprecated in django CMS 5) has been removed. This also includes the removal of the two classes
  ``cms.utils.placeholder.PlaceholderNoAction`` and ``cms.utils.placeholder.MLNGPlaceholderActions``. If you need these classes,
  move them to your own codebase.

Permissions
-----------

``cms.utils.permissions.has_page_permission()`` has been removed. Use
:func:`cms.utils.page_permissions.has_generic_permission()` instead.

As part of performance improvements, the following methods have been removed from
``cms.utils.page_permissions``. They were deprecated in django CMS 4.1:

* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_add_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_change_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_change_advanced_settings_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_change_permissions_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_get_delete_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_move_page_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_publish_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_view_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.permissions.get_view_restrictions()``


Menus
-----

* ``cms.cms_menus.get_visible_nodes`` has been removed. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_visible_page_contents`` instead.

* ``cms.cms_menus.get_menu_node_for_page`` has been removed. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_menu_node_for_page_content`` instead.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* The ``title`` property has been removed from ``cms.cms_toolbars.PageToolbar``.
  Use ``cms.cms_toolbars.PageTooolbar.page_content`` instead.

* ``cms.forms.get_root_nodes`` has been removed. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_root_pages`` instead.

* ``cms.extensions.toolbar.ExtensionToolbar.get_title_extension_admin`` has been removed.
  Use ``cms.extensions.toolbar.ExtensionToolbar.get_page_content_extension_admin`` instead.

* ``cms.toolbar.utils.get_plugin_tree_as_json`` has been removed. Use ``cms.toolbar.utils.get_plugin_tree`` and convert the result
  to JSON instead.
