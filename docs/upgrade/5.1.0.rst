Removal of deprecated functionality
===================================

API
---

``cms.api.create_title`` has been removed. Use :meth:`cms.api.create_page_content` instead.


``StaticPlaceholder``
---------------------

* ``StaticPlaceholder`` has been removed from ``cms.models`` and ``cms.admin``.
Use `static aliases <https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-alias>`_ instead.

* This implies that ``cms.plugin_rendering`` does not accept static placeholders any more.

* The ``static_placeholder`` template tag has been removed.

Placehoders
-----------

* ``PlaceholderField`` has been removed from ``cms.fields``. Use :class:`~cms.models.fields.PlaceholderRelationField` in conjunction with
:meth:`~cms.utils.placeholder.get_placeholder_from_slot` instead (also see :ref:`placeholders_outside_cms`).

* ``PlaceholderAdminMixin`` has been removed from ``cms.admin``. It is not needed anymore and can be savely removed from your code.

* A placeholder's ``actions`` property (deprecated in django CMS 5) has been removed. This also includes the removal of the two classes
  ``cms.utils.placeholder.PlaceholderNoAction`` and ``cms.utils.placeholder.MLNGPlaceholderActions``. If you need these classes,
  move them to your own codebase.

Permissions
-----------

``cms.utils.permissions.has_page_permission()`` has been removed. Use
:meth:`cms.utils.page_permissions.has_generic_permission()` instead.

As part of performance improvements, the following methods have been removed from
``cms.utils.page_permissions``. They were deprecated in django CMS 4.1:

* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_add_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_change_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_change_advanced_settings_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_change_permissions_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_get_delete_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_move_page_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_publish_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.page_permissions.get_view_ids()``
* ``cms.utils.permissions.get_view_restrictions()``


Menus
-----

* ``cms.cms_menus.get_visible_nodes`` has been removed. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_visible_page_contents`` instead.

* ``cms.cms_menus.get_menu_node_for_page`` has been removed. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_menu_node_for_page_content`` instead.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* The ``title`` property has been removed from ``cms.cms_toolbars.PageToolbar``.
  Use ``cms.cms_toolbars.PageTooolbar.page_content`` instead.

* ``cms.forms.get_root_nodes`` has been removed. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_root_pages`` instead.

* ``cms.extensions.toolbar.ExtensionToolbar.get_title_extension_admin`` has been removed.
  Use ``cms.extensions.toolbar.ExtensionToolbar.get_page_content_extension_admin`` instead.

* ``cms.toolbar.utils.get_plugin_tree_as_json`` has been removed. Use ``cms.toolbar.utils.get_plugin_tree`` and convert the result
  to JSON instead.
