.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    django CMS 4.1 is the **first community release** of django CMS 4. Django CMS 4 introduces changes that **require** action if you are upgrading from a 3.x version. Please read the step-by-step guide to the
    process of upgrading from 3.5+ to 4 here: :ref:`upgrade-to-4.0`


Welcome to django CMS 4.1.4!

Security fix
============

django CMS 4.1.4 closes a security vulnerability that could allow an attacker
to inject malicious code into the page title allowing to load arbitrary
javascript code when viewing the page. We recommend that you upgrade to
this version as soon as possible.

The security issue is of low severity, since an attacker needs to have access
to the django CMS admin interface to exploit it.

Thanks to `Ali Ä°ltizar (@alii76tt) <https://twitter.com/alii76tt>`_ for
reporting the issue.

.. note::

   As ever, we remind our users and contributors that all security reports,
   patches and concerns be addressed only to our security team by email, at
   `security@django-cms.org <mailto:security@django-cms.org>`_.
