Treebeard corruption
====================

Prior to 3.2.1 moving or pasting nested plugins would lead to some non-fatal
tree corruptions, raising an error when adding plugins under the newly
pasted plugins.

To fix these problems, upgrade to 3.2.1 and then run ``manage.py cms fix-tree``
command to repair the tree.


DjangoCMS Text CKEditor
=======================

Action required
---------------
CMS 3.2.1 is not compatible with djangocms-text-ckeditor < 2.8.1.
If you're using djangocms-text-ckeditor, please upgrade to 2.8.1 or up.
