4.2.0 release notes
###################

*October 31, 2024*

Welcome to django CMS 4.2.0!

These release notes cover the new features, as well as some backwards
incompatible changes you’ll want to be aware of when upgrading from
django CMS 4.1 or earlier. We’ve begun the deprecation process for some
features.

See the How to upgrade to 4.2.0 to a newer version guide if you’re
updating an existing project.

Django and Python compatibility
===============================

django CMS supports **Django 4.2, 5.0, and 5.1**. We highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

It supports **Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12**. As for Django we highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

**************************************
Backward incompatible changes in 4.2.0
**************************************

Merging of Page.node into Page
==============================

To improve performance and simplify database accesses, the ``TreeNode`` model
has been merged into the ``Page`` model. This change is backward incompatible
and will require a database migration.

Compatibility shims have been added to the ``Page`` model to ensure that custom
code that accesses the ``Page.node`` attribute will continue to work. However,
this compatibility shim will be removed in django CMS 4.3 release. For now,
they raise a ``RemovedInDjangoCMS43Warning`` warning.

Most prominent changes to custom code are:

* Pages have a ``site`` field again: ``page.node.site`` becomes ``page.site``
* ``page.node.path`` becomes ``page.path``
* ``page.node.depth`` becomes ``page.depth``
* ``page.node.numchild`` becomes ``page.numchild``
* ``page.node.parent`` and ``page.page_parent`` become ``page.parent``

Please also check your ``.filter()``, ``.order()``, ``.select_related()``, and
``.prefetch_related()`` calls to ensure they are still correct:
``.filter(node__site=site)`` becomes ``.filter(site=site)`` etc.

If you have custom code that accesses the ``Page.node`` attribute, you should
update it to use the new attributes on the ``Page`` model.

Miscellaneous
=============

* The function ``cms.cms_menus.get_visible_nodes`` has been deprecated. For
  performance reasons, the ``cms_menus`` builds the navigation node list based
  on page content objects. Use ``cms.cms_menus.get_visible_page_contents``
  instead.

Features deprecated in 4.2.0
============================

* Use of the ``node`` property of the :class:`~cms.models.pagemodel.Page` model
  is deprecated. Use its attributes on the :class:`~cms.models.pagemodel.Page`
  model directly instead.

Removal of deprecated functionality
===================================

* Built-in alias plugin: The alias plugin has been removed. If you need
  this functionality, you can use the ``djangocms-alias`` package.

* ``SuperLazyIterator``: This class has been removed. If you need this
  functionality, you can use the ``django.utils.functional.lazy``.

* ``LazyChoiceField``: This class has been removed. If you need this
  functionality, you can use the default ``django.forms.fields.ChoiceField`` class.

* ``SlugWidget``: This class has been removed from ``cms.wizard.forms``. If you
  need this functionality, you can use the ``cms.admin.forms.SlugWidget`` class.
