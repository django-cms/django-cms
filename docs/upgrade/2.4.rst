2.4 release notes (IN DEVELOPMENT)
##################################

*****************
What's new in 2.4
*****************


.. _upgrade-to-2.4:

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    2.4 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version.
    
    You will need to read the sections :ref:`migrations-upgrade` and
    :ref:`cms-moderator-upgrade` below.


.. _migrations-upgrade:

Migrations overhaul
===================
In version 2.4 migrations have been completely rewritten to address issues with
newer South releases.

To ease the upgrading process, all the migrations for the `cms` application have
been consolidated into a single migration file, `0001_initial.py`.

*   migration 0001 is a *real* migration, that gets you to the same point migrations 0001-0036 used to 
*   the migrations 0002 to 0036 inclusive still exist, but are now all *dummy*
    migrations
*   migrations 0037 and later are *new* migrations

How this affects you
--------------------

If you're starting with *a new installation*, you don't need to worry about
this. Don't even bother reading this section; it's for upgraders.

If you're using version *2.3.2 or newer*, you don't need to worry about this
either.

If you're using version *2.3.1 or older*, you will need to run a two-step
process.

First, you'll need to upgrade to 2.3.3, to bring your migration history
up-to-date with the new scheme. Then you'll need to perform the migrations for
2.4.

For the two-step upgrade process do the following in your project main directory
::

    pip install django-cms==2.3.3
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    pip install django-cms==2.4
    python manage.py migrate

Added delete orphaned plugins command
=====================================

Added a management command for deleting orphaned plugins from the database.

The command can be run with:

	manage.py cms delete_orphaned_plugins

Please read :ref:`cms-delete-orphaned-plugins-command` before using.

.. _cms-moderator-upgrade:

Addded a check command
======================

Added a management command to check your configuration and environment.

To use th command, simply run:

    manage.py cms check

This replaces the old at-runtime checks.

CMS_MODERATOR
=============
Has been removed since it is no longer in use. From 2.4 onwards, all pages
exist in a public and draft version. Users with the ``publish_page`` permission
can publish changes to the public site.

.. admonition:: Management command required

    To bring a previous version of your site's database up-to-date, you'll
    need to run ``manage.py cms moderator on``. **Never run this command
    without first checking for orphaned plugins**, using the ``cms list
    plugins`` command. If it reports problems, run ``manage.py cms
    delete_orphaned_plugins``. Running ``cms moderator`` with orphaned plugins
    will fail and leave bad data in your database. See :ref:`cms-list-command`
    and :ref:`cms-delete-orphaned-plugins-command`.


Added Fix MPTTT Management command
==================================

Added a management command for fixing MPTT tree data.

The command can be run with:

	manage.py cms fix-mptt
	

Removed the MultilingualMiddleware
==================================

We removed the MultilingualMiddleware. This removed the very ugly monkey patching of the
reverse() function as well. As a benefit we now support localization of urls and Apphook urls with standard django helpers.


For django 1.4 more infos can be found here:

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns

If you are still running django 1.3 you are able to archieve the same functionality with django-i18nurl. It is a backport
of the new functionality in django 1.4 and can be found here:

    https://github.com/brocaar/django-i18nurls


What you need to do:

- Remove the MultilingualMiddleware from your settings.
- Be sure the LocaleMiddleware is in your settings and that it comes after the SessionMiddleware.
- Be sure that the cms.urls is included in a i18n_patterns::

        from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
        from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.conf import settings

        admin.autodiscover()

        urlpatterns = i18n_patterns('',
            url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
            url(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
        )

        if settings.DEBUG:
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
            url(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve',
                {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'show_indexes': True}),
            url(r'', include('django.contrib.staticfiles.urls')),
        ) + urlpatterns

- Change your url and reverse calls to language namespaces. We now support the django way of
  calling other language urls either via '{% language %}' templatetag or via 'activate("de")' function call in views.

  Before ::

        {% url "de:myview" %}

  After::

        {% load i18n %}{% language "de" %}
        {% url "myview_name" %}
        {% endlanguage %}

- reverse urls now return the language prefix as well. So maybe there is some code that adds language prefixes. Remove
  this code.

CMS_LANGUAGES
=============

:setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES` has be overhauled. It is no longer a list of tuples like the ``LANGUAGES`` settings.

An example explains more than thousand words::

    CMS_LANGUAGES = {
            1: [
                {
                    'code': 'en',
                    'name': gettext('English'),
                    'fallbacks': ['de', 'fr'],
                    'public': True,
                    'hide_untranslated': True,
                    'redirect_on_fallback':False,
                },
                {
                    'code': 'de',
                    'name': gettext('Deutsch'),
                    'fallbacks': ['en', 'fr'],
                    'public': True,
                },
                {
                    'code': 'fr',
                    'name': gettext('French'),
                    'public': False,
                },
            ],
            2: [
                {
                    'code': 'nl',
                    'name': gettext('Dutch'),
                    'public': True,
                    'fallbacks': ['en'],
                },
            ],
            'default': {
                'fallbacks': ['en', 'de', 'fr'],
                'redirect_on_fallback':True,
                'public': False,
                'hide_untranslated': False,
            }
        }


For more details on what all the parameters mean please refer to the :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES` docs.

The following settings are not needed any more and have been removed:

- `CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED`
- `CMS_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK`
- `CMS_LANGUAGE_CONF`
- `CMS_SITE_LANGUAGES`
- `CMS_FRONTEND_LANGUAGES`

Please remove them from your settings.py

CMS_FLAT_URLS
=============

Was marked deprecated in 2.3 and has now been removed.



Plugins in Plugins
==================

We added the ability to have plugins in plugins. Till now only the TextPlugin supportet this.
For demonstration purposes we created a MultiColumn Plugin. The Possiblities for this are endless.
Imagine: StylePlugin, TablePlugin, GalleryPlugin etc.

The column plugin can be found here:

https://github.com/divio/djangocms-column

At the moment the limitation is that plugins in plugins is only editable in the frontend.

Here is the MultiColumn Plugin as an example::
	
	class MultiColumnPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
	    model = MultiColumns
	    name = _("Multi Columns")
	    render_template = "cms/plugins/multi_column.html"
	    allow_children = True
	    child_classes = ["ColumnPlugin"]
	
There are 2 new properties for plugins:

**allow_children**

Boolean
If set to True it allows adding Plugins.

**child_classes**

List
A List of Plugin Classes that can be added to this plugin.
If not provided you can add all plugins that are available in this placeholder.

How to render your child plugins in the template
------------------------------------------------

We introduce a new templatetag in the cms_tags called `{% render_plugin %}`
Here is an example of how the MultiColumn plugin uses it::
	
	{% load cms_tags %}
	<div class="multicolumn">
	{% for plugin in instance.child_plugins %}
    	{% render_plugin plugin %}
	{% endfor %}
	</div>

As you can see the children are accessible via the plugins childrens attribute.


New way to handle django CMS settings
=====================================

If you have code that needs to access django CMS settings (settings prefixed
with ``CMS_`` or ``PLACEHOLDER_``) you would have used for example
``from django.conf import settings; settings.CMS_TEMPLATES``. This will no
longer guarantee to return sane values, instead you should use
``django.utils.conf.get_cms_setting`` which takes the name of the setting
**without** the ``CMS_`` prefix as argument and returns the setting.

Example of old, now deprecated style::

    from django.conf import settings

    settings.CMS_TEMPLATES
    settings.PLACEHOLDER_FRONTEND_EDITING

Should be replaced with the new API::

    from cms.utils.conf import get_cms_setting

    get_cms_setting('TEMPLATES')
    get_cms_setting('PLACEHOLDER_FRONTEND_EDITING')


Added ``cms.constants`` module
==============================

This release adds the ``cms.constants`` module which will hold generic django
CMS constant values. Currently it only contains ``TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE_MAGIC``
which used to live in ``cms.conf.global_settings`` but was moved to the new
``cms.constants`` module in the settings overhaul mentioned above.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

If you are running django 1.3.X you need to install django-i18nurls, if you want
multilingual features. The cms.urls needs to be in a i18n url pattern.


********************
Pending deprecations
********************

* ``simple_language_changer`` will be removed in version 2.5. A bugfix makes
  this redundant as every non managed url will behave like this.
