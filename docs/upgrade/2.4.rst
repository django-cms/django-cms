What's new in 2.4
*****************

Removed the MultilingualMiddleware
==================================

We removed the MultilingualMiddleware. This removed the very ugly monkey patching of the
reverse() function as well. As a benefit we now support localization of urls and Apphook urls with standard django helpers.


For django 1.4 more infos can be found here:

    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/#internationalization-in-url-patterns

If you are still running django 1.3 you are able to archieve the same functionality with django-i18nurl. It is a backport
of the new functionality in django 1.4 and can be found here:

    https://github.com/brocaar/django-i18nurls


What you need to do:

- Remove the MultilingualMiddleware from your settings.
- Be sure the LocaleMiddleware is in your settings and that it comes after the SessionMiddleware.
- Be sure that the cms.urls is included in a i18n_patterns::

        from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
        from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns
        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.conf import settings

        admin.autodiscover()

        urlpatterns = i18n_patterns('',
            url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
            url(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
        )

        if settings.DEBUG:
            urlpatterns = patterns('',
            url(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve',
                {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'show_indexes': True}),
            url(r'', include('django.contrib.staticfiles.urls')),
        ) + urlpatterns

- Change your url and reverse calls to language namespaces. We now support the django way of
  calling other language urls either via '{% language %}' templatetag or via 'activate("de")' function call in views.

  Before ::

        {% url "de:myview" %}

  After::

        {% load i18n %}{% language "de" %}
        {% url "myview_name" %}
        {% endlanguage %}

- reverse urls now return the language prefix as well. So maybe there is some code that adds language prefixes. Remove
  this code.

CMS_LANGUAGES
=============

:setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES` has be overhauled. It is no longer a list of tuples like the ``LANGUAGES`` settings.

An example explains more than thousand words::

    CMS_LANGUAGES = {
            1: [
                {
                    'code': 'en',
                    'name': gettext('English'),
                    'fallbacks': ['de', 'fr'],
                    'public': True,
                    'hide_untranslated': True,
                    'redirect_on_fallback':False,
                },
                {
                    'code': 'de',
                    'name': gettext('Deutsch'),
                    'fallbacks': ['en', 'fr'],
                    'public': True,
                },
                {
                    'code': 'fr',
                    'name': gettext('French'),
                    'public': False,
                },
            ],
            2: [
                {
                    'code': 'nl',
                    'name': gettext('Dutch'),
                    'public': True,
                    'fallbacks': ['en'],
                },
            ],
            'default': {
                'fallbacks': ['en', 'de', 'fr'],
                'redirect_on_fallback':True,
                'public': False,
                'hide_untranslated': False,
            }
        }


For more details on what all the parameters mean please refer to the :setting:`CMS_LANGUAGES` docs.

The following settings are not needed any more and have been removed:

- `CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED`
- `CMS_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK`
- `CMS_LANGUAGE_CONF`
- `CMS_SITE_LANGUAGES`
- `CMS_FRONTEND_LANGUAGES`

Please remove them from your settings.py


.. _migrations-upgrade:

Migrations overhaul
===================
In version 2.4 migrations have been completely rewritten to fix issues with
newer South releases.

To ease upgrading process migration numbering and naming have not been changed,
but only the first one for each application has actual migration code, so it's of
utmost importance that you have an up to date migration history.

To ensure this, when upgrading from 2.3.1 and older releases, please upgrate to
2.3.3 first, execute all the migrations and then move to 2.4.

For the two step upgrade process do the following in your project main directory ::

    pip install django-cms==2.3.3
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    pip install django-cms==2.4


CMS_FLAT_URLS
=============

Was marked deprecated in 2.3 and has now been removed.

CMS_MODERATOR
=============
Has been deprecated since it is no longer in use. From 2.4 onwards, all pages
exist in a public and draft version. Users with the ``publish_page`` permission
can publish changes to the public site.

To ensure that a site that was set up using a previous version is up to date,
run ``manage.py moderator on``.

    Feature description

Minor improvements
==================

.. * Some minor improvement.


******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

New minimum requirements for dependencies
=========================================

If you are running django 1.3.X you need to install django-i18nurls, if you want
multilingual features. The cms.urls needs to be in a i18n url pattern.


********************
Pending deprecations
********************

* ``simple_language_changer`` will be removed in version 2.5. A bugfix makes
  this redundant as every non managed url will behave like this.
