###################

*May 21, 2025*

Welcome to django CMS 5.0.1!

These release notes cover the new features, as well as some backwards
incompatible changes you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from
django CMS 4.1 or earlier. We've begun the deprecation process for some
features.

*******************************
Django and Python compatibility
*******************************

django CMS supports **Django 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2**. We highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

It supports **Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13**. As for Django we highly recommend and only
support the latest release of each series.

***********************
How to upgrade to 5.0.1
***********************

Update your projectâ€™s ``requirements.txt`` file to require (at least) django CMS 5.0.1 and
run ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of django CMS, read the release
notes for all the versions between your current version and this one. Check
the :ref:`release notes <release-notes>` for each version to see if there are
any special instructions.

Run migrations::

    python -m manage migrate

.. warning::

    Since the migrations merge the ``TreeNode`` and ``Page`` models, you should run the
    migration in a test environment first to ensure that the migration runs
    successfully.
