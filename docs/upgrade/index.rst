Release notes & upgrade information
###################################

Some versions of django CMS present more complex upgrade paths than others, and some **require** you
to take action. It is strongly recommended to read the release notes carefully when upgrading.

It goes without saying that you should **backup your database** before embarking on any process that
makes changes to your database.
