How to upgrade to 3.11.10
*************************

We assume you are upgrading from django CMS 3.11.9.

Please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy
state, and **make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Then run::

    python manage.py migrate  # to ensure that your database is up-to-date with migrations
    python manage.py cms fix-tree

Check custom code and third-party applications for use of deprecated or removed functionality or
APIs (see above). Some third-party components may need to be updated.

Install the new version of django CMS from GitHub or via pip.

Run::

    python manage.py migrate

to apply the new migrations.
