3.0.6 release notes

*******************
What's new in 3.0.6
*******************

Django 1.7 support
==================

As of version 3.0.6 django CMS supports Django 1.7.

Currently our migrations for Django 1.7 are in ``cms/migrations_django`` to
allow better backward compatibility; in future releases the Django migrations
will be moved to the standard ``migrations`` directory, with the South
migrations in ``south_migrations``.

To support the current arrangement you need to add the following to your
``settings``::

    MIGRATION_MODULES = {
        'cms': 'cms.migrations_django',
        'menus': 'menus.migrations_django',
    }

.. warning:: **Applications migrations**

    **Any** application that defines a django CMS plugin or a model that uses a
    PlaceholderField or depends in any way on django CMS models **must** also
    provide Django 1.7 migrations.

Extended Custom User Support
============================

If you are using custom user models and use ``CMS_PERMISSION = True`` then be
sure to check that ``PageUserAdmin`` and ``PageUserGroup`` is still in working
order.

The ``PageUserAdmin`` class now extends dynamically from the admin class that
handles the user model. This allows us to use the same ``search_fields`` and
filters in ``PageUserAdmin`` as in the custom user model admin.

``CMSPlugin.get_render_template``
=================================

A new method on plugins, that returns the template during the render phase,
allowing you to change the template based on any plugin attribute or context
status. See :doc:`/how_to/09-custom_plugins` for more.

Simplified toolbar API for page extensions
==========================================

A simpler, more compact way to extend the toolbar for page extensions: :ref:`simplified_extension_toolbar`.
