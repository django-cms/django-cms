Installation
============

This document assumes that you are familiar with python and django.

A more beginner friendly tutorial should be written shortly.

Make sure that `cms`, `mptt` and `publisher` folders are on your pythonpath.
They all should come with the distribution.

python 2.4 - 2.6 should be supported

django 1.1 is required at this moment.

Apps
----

Add the following to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting if not already present::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		'django.contrib.auth',
		'django.contrib.contenttypes',
		'django.contrib.sessions',
		'django.contrib.admin',
		'django.contrib.sites',
		...
		'cms',
		'cms.plugins.text',
		'cms.plugins.picture',
		'cms.plugins.link',
		'cms.plugins.file',
		'cms.plugins.snippet',
		'cms.plugins.googlemap',
		'mptt',
		'publisher'
		...
	)

Django-cms is compatible with `django-reversion <http://code.google.com/p/django-reversion/>`_ for versioning all the page content and its plugins. Put ``reversion`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` if you have it installed.

If you don't need all the plugins you can comment them out here. For a complete list of all the plugins have a look inside ``cms/plugins/``.

The following apps are also required by the cms:

	'django.contrib.admin'
	'django.contrib.sites',

Middleware
----------

Add the following middleware classes::

	MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
		# needed for add/edit page
		'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
		'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
		'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
		...
		'cms.middleware.page.CurrentPageMiddleware',
		'cms.middleware.user.CurrentUserMiddleware',
		'cms.middleware.multilingual.MultilingualURLMiddleware',
		...
	)

If your site is not multilingual you can leave out ``'cms.middleware.MutilingualURLMiddleware'``.

Note:

- Be sure that ``cms.middleware.user.CurrentUserMiddleware`` comes after ``django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware``.
- Be sure that ``cms.middleware.multilingual.MultilingualURLMiddleware`` comes after ``django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddlewar``.

Template Context Processors
---------------------------

Add the following template context processors if not already present::

	TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
		"django.core.context_processors.auth",
		"django.core.context_processors.i18n",
		"django.core.context_processors.request",
		"django.core.context_processors.media",
		"cms.context_processors.media",
		...
	)

Templates
---------

If you don't have already a ``gettext`` stub in your ``settings.py`` file, insert the following line
near the beginning of the file but after any import statements that it may have::

	gettext = lambda s: s

This allows you to use ``gettext`` in ``settings.py``.

Add some templates you want to use within django-cms that contain at least one

``{% placeholder %}`` template tag to your ``settings.py``::

	CMS_TEMPLATES = (
		('base.html', gettext('default')),
		('2col.html', gettext('2 Column')),
		('3col.html', gettext('3 Column')),
		('extra.html', gettext('Some extra fancy template')),
	)

For some template examples see the templates used in the example project.

Here's a quick example of what a template might look like::

	{% load cms_tags %}

	<div id="menu">{% show_menu 0 100 100 100 %}</div>
	<div id="breadcrumb">{% show_breadcrumb %}</div>
	<div id="languagechooser">{% language_chooser %}</div>
	<div id="content">{% placeholder "content" %}</div>
	<div id="left_column">{% placeholder "left_column" %}</div>

Internationalization
--------------------

If your site is multilingual be sure to have the ``LANGUAGES`` setting present in your ``settings.py`` file::

	LANGUAGES = (
		('fr', gettext('French')),
		('de', gettext('German')),
		('en', gettext('English')),
	)

The ´´LANGUAGE_CODE``also must be set to a language that is present in the LANGUAGES touple::

	LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'

This defines the default language.

urls.py
-------


In your main ``urls.py`` add the following line at the **end** of the ``urlpatterns`` definition::

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        ...
        ...
        url(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
    )

Other settings
--------------

For a list of all settings that can be overridden in your ``settings.py`` file have a look at ``cms/conf/global_settings.py``.

More information is available in the docs folder: `cms/docs/ <http://github.com/digi604/django-cms-2.0/tree/master/cms/docs>`_
You may also want to have a look at the example project to see what settings it uses.

Media Files
-----------

**ATTENTION:**

Be sure to copy the ``cms/media/cms/`` folder into your media directory or make a symbolic
link as appropriate.

If installed with pip in a virtualenv the media files may be located in the root folder of the the virtualenv.

You can use something like `django-appmedia <http://code.google.com/p/django-appmedia/>`_ that handles this for you.


South
-----

Django-cms has support for `django-south <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_. South is a database migration tool.
So if you get a new version of django-cms you also get the db-migrations automatically. Please read the documentation of south
first before you use it the first time.

If there is a problem with python manage.py migrate:

Create a new ticket on github with your database engine (mysql, postgres), database type (MyIsam, InnoDB), south version
There are known problems with SQLite and MySQL InnoDB but the Quickfix below should help.

Quick fix:

* Remove ``south`` from the installed apps.
* Reset database
* run ``manage.py syncdb``
* add ``south`` to the installed apps again.
* run ``manage.py syncdb``
* run ``manage.py migrate --fake``


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you create a page and you don't see a page in the list view:

- Be sure you copied all the media files. Check with firebug and its "net" panel if you have any 404s

If you edit a Page but don't see a "Add Plugin" button and a dropdown-list with plugins:

- Be sure your CMS_TEMPLATES setting is correct and that the templates specified actually exist. Maybe check that you are not missing a '{% placeholder %}' templatetag in the template.
