Django CMS Tutorial
===================

Installation
-------------

I am working on Ubuntu 9.10 here, not windows or mac...sorry, although I don't expect things will be much different for mac at least...if I get a chance i'll run through this process on windows too and update the article but no promises.

I'm assuming that Python, Django and sqlite3 are installed already. For reference, I am currently using Python 2.6.4 and Django (trunk version) 1.2.

If you dont already have one, create a new folder for your code to live in. My folder lives in my home directory and is named "django_apps". This will pop up throughout this guide so if you're following along and you call yours something else, remember to replace "django_apps" with the name of your own folder when the time comes.

In a terminal, move into your code directory::

	CD ~/django_apps

Create a new Django project (call this whatever you like but remember to change it if you're following along and have called it something else)::

	django-admin.py startproject project-name

No harm in making sure that all is indeed well with Django at this early stage so::

	CD project-name

And... ::

	python manage.py runserver 

Head on over to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and if you see "it worked" then well, its working.

Here comes the science...

If you dont happen to know your Python location then issue the following command::

	which python
	
(my one is "/usr/local/lib/python2.6" for example)

Go to your Python dist-packages directory "your-python-path/dist-packages"
 
Download the latest and greatest Django CMS from here: http://www.django-cms.org/en/downloads/

Unzip the downloaded file into the "dist-packages" directory...you will need to do this as "sudo" unless you have your system set up wrongly ;)

Make copies of the following directories like so::

	sudo cp -R digi604-django-cms-2.0-c0288a1/cms/ cms
	sudo cp -R digi604-django-cms-2.0-c0288a1/mptt/ mptt
	sudo cp -R digi604-django-cms-2.0-c0288a1/publisher/ publisher

Do a bit of house cleaning to get rid of all the files you don't need::

	sudo rm -rf digi604-django-cms-2.0-c0288a1.zip
	sudo rm -rf digi604-django-cms-2.0-c0288a1/

Head back to the project you created previously::

	cd ~/django_apps/project-name

In your editor, edit "settings.py" like so:

On lines 1+2 put the following before anything else::

	import os
	PROJECT_PATH = os.path.realpath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

Then, after the import statements, add this::

	gettext = lambda s: s

Set up the remainder of the file with the following changes/additions::

	DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
	DATABASE_NAME = '/path/to/your/data/your-db-name.db/

	MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_PATH, 'media')
	MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

	ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX = '/media/admin/'

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
	    'django.contrib.auth',
	    'django.contrib.admin',
	    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	    'django.contrib.sessions',
	    'django.contrib.sites',
	    'django.contrib.messages',
	    'cms',
	    'cms.plugins.text',
	    'cms.plugins.picture',
	    'cms.plugins.link',
	    'cms.plugins.file',
	    'cms.plugins.snippet',
	    'cms.plugins.googlemap',
	    'mptt',
	    'publisher',
		'menus',
	)

	MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
		'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',
	    'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
	    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
	    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
	    'django.middleware.doc.XViewMiddleware',
	    'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',
	    'cms.middleware.page.CurrentPageMiddleware', 
	    'cms.middleware.user.CurrentUserMiddleware', 
		'cms.middleware.toolbar.ToolbarMiddleware',
		'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware', 
	)
	
	TEMPLATE_DIRS = os.path.join(PROJECT_PATH, 'templates')
	# (templates being the name of my template dir within project-name)

	TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
	    'django.core.context_processors.auth', 
	    'django.core.context_processors.i18n', 
	    'django.core.context_processors.request', 
	    'django.core.context_processors.media', 
	    'cms.context_processors.media',
	)
	
(I didn't have a ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`` specified so had to add all of the above anew.)

Set up your available templates (don't worry that they don't actually exist yet)::

	CMS_TEMPLATES = ( 
	    ('base.html', gettext('default')), 
	    ('2col.html', gettext('2 Column')), 
	    ('3col.html', gettext('3 Column')), 
	    ('extra.html', gettext('Some extra fancy template')),
	) 

Next, Edit your ``urls.py`` file like this::

	from django.conf.urls.defaults import *
	from django.contrib import admin
	from django.conf import settings

	admin.autodiscover()

	urlpatterns = patterns('',
	    (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
	)

	if settings.DEBUG:
	    urlpatterns += patterns('',
	        url(r'^media/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve', {'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'show_indexes': True})
	    )

	urlpatterns += patterns('',
	    url(r'^', include('cms.urls')),
	)

Create a folder called 'media' in your project root (that's "project-name" for me), this means you create a symbolic link from the "cms/media/cms" folder in "dist-packages" to your new "media" folder::

	ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/cms/media/cms cms

Now for the magic...if you're not already there::

	cd ~/django_apps/project-name

and... ::

	python manage.py syncdb

If all goes well, you'll be asked if you want to set up your superuser account...which of course you do so just follow the instructions in the terminal.

That should hopefully be that. If your development server is still running in your terminal stop it, then restart it again just to be sure. ::

	cmd c
	python manage.py runserver

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to make sure all is well, you'll be greeted with appropriate text and if you can see the django-cms logo then your media folder is cool also.

log in via the admin link (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) and enjoy :)
