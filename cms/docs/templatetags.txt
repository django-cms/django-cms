Templatetags
============

To use any of the following templatetags you need to load them first at the top of your template::

	{% load cms_tags menu_tags %}

placeholder
-----------

The ``placeholder`` templatetag will be filled with plugins. The cms auto-detects all placeholders
used in the template.

Example::

	{% placeholder "content" %}
	
You can additionally give the placeholder a width attribute::

	{% placeholder "content" "230" %}
	
If a width is provided every plugin recieves a "width" context variable when the plugin is rendered.
The main use case of the width attribute is for automatically resizing images correctly.

Also be sure to check out the ``PLACEHOLDER_CONF`` setting where you can change some of the behavior
of the placeholders.

placeholderor
-------------

The same as ``placeholder``, with additional content to be displayed in case the placeholder is empty:
If the placeholder has no plugins or the plugins do not generate any output, everything between 
``{% placeholderor %}`` and ``{% endplaceholderor %}`` is rendered instead.

Example::

	{% placeholderor "content" %}There is no content.{% endplaceholderor %}

show_placeholder_by_id
----------------------

Displays the placeholder of a page with an id.

Attributes:

- placeholder_name
- reverse_id
- language (optional)
- site (optional)

Example::

	{% show_placeholder_by_id "content" "footer_page" %}

show_uncached_placeholder_by_id
-------------------------------

The same as ``show_placeholder_by_id`` but is not cached.

Attributes:

- placeholder_name
- reverse_id
- language (optional)
- site (optional)

Example::

	{% show_uncached_placeholder_by_id "content" "footer_page" %}

plugins_media
-------------

Returns all media that is used by plugins and is defined with a Media class
You normally want to place this in your <head> tag.

example::

	{% plugins_media %}
	
For a reference on what plugin media is used look in the plugin reference.

page_attribute
--------------

This templatetag is used to display an attribute of the current page in the current language.

Example::

	{% page_attribute page_title %}
	
Possible attributes:

- title
- menu_title
- page_title
- slug
- meta_description
- meta_keywords

As an optional second argument you can provide a page id. Page ids can be set in the advanced
settings tab of a page.

Example::

	{% page_attribute page_title my_page_id %}	

show_menu
---------

``{& show_menu %}`` renders the navigation of the current page.
You can overwrite the appearance and the HTML if you add a ``cms/menu.html``
template to your project or edit the one provided with django-cms.
``show_menu`` takes four optional parameters: ``start_level``, ``end_level``,
``extra_inactive``, and ``extra_active``.

The first two parameters, ``start_level`` (default=0) and ``end_level`` (default=100) specify from what level to which level
should the navigation be rendered.
If you have a home as a root node and don't want to display home you can render the navigation only after level 1.

The third parameter, ``extra_inactive`` (default=0), specifies how many levels of navigation should be displayed
if a node is not a direct ancestor or descendant of the current active node.

Finally, the fourth parameter, ``extra_active`` (default=100), specifies how many levels of
descendants of the currently active node should be displayed.

Some Examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete navigation (as a nested list)::

	{% load cache cms_tags %}
	<ul>
		{% show_menu 0 100 100 100 %}
	</ul>

Navigation with active tree (as a nested list)::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu 0 100 0 100 %}
	</ul>

Navigation with only one active extra level::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu 0 100 0 1 %}
	</ul>

Level 1 navigation (as a nested list)::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu 1 %}
	</ul>

Navigation with a custom template::

	{% show_menu 0 100 100 100 "myapp/menu.html" %}

show_menu_below_id
------------------

If you have set an id in the advanced settings of a page, you can display the submenu of this page with
a template tag.  For example, we have a page called meta that is not displayed in the navigation and that
has the id "meta"::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu_below_id "meta" %}
	</ul>

You can give it the same optional parameters as ``show_menu``::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu_below_id "meta" 0 100 100 100 "myapp/menu.html" %}
	</ul>

show_sub_menu
-------------

Display the sub menu of the current page (as a nested list).
Takes one argument that specifies how many levels deep should the submenu be displayed.
The template can be found at ``cms/sub_menu.html``::

	<ul>
    	{% show_sub_menu 1 %}
	</ul>

Or with a custom template::

	<ul>
		{% show_sub_menu 1 "myapp/submenu.html" %}
	</ul>

show_breadcrumb
---------------

Show the breadcrumb navigation of the current page.
The template for the HTML can be found at ``cms/breadcrumb.html``.::

	{% show_breadcrumb %}

Or with a custom template and only display level 2 or higher::

	{% show_breadcrumb 2 "myapp/breadcrumb.html" %}

If the current URL is not handled by the CMS or by a navigation extender,
the current menu node can not be determined.
In this case you may need to provide your own breadcrumb via the template.
This is mostly needed for pages like login, logout and third-party apps.
This can easily be accomplished by a block you overwrite in your templates.

For example in your base.html:

	<ul>
		{% block breadcrumb %}
		{% show_breadcrumb %}
		{% endblock %}
	<ul>
	
And then in your app template:

	{% block breadcrumb %}
	<li><a href="/">home</a></li>
	<li>My current page</li>
	{% endblock %} 
	
	
page_language_url
-----------------

Returns the url of the current page in an other language::

	{% page_language_url de %}
	{% page_language_url fr %}
	{% page_language_url en %}

If the current url has no cms-page and is handled by a navigation extender and the url changes based on the language:
You will need to set a language_changer function with the set_language_changer function in cms.utils.

For more information have a look in the i18n docs.

language_chooser
----------------

The ``language_chooser`` template tag will display a language chooser for the current page.
You can modify the template in ``cms/language_chooser.html`` or provide your own template if necessary.

Example::

	{% language_chooser %}
	
or with custom template::

	{% language_chooser "myapp/language_chooser.html" %}


If the current url has no cms-page and is handled by a navigation extender and the url changes based on the language:
You will need to set a language_changer function with the set_language_changer function in cms.utils.

For more information have a look in the i18n docs.

#TODO: link to i18n

page_id_url
-----------

This template tag returns the URL of a page that has a symbolic name, known as
``id`` or  ``reverse_id``.  For example, you could have a help page that you want to display a link to 
on every page.  To do this, you would go to the help page in the admin interface and
enter a id (such as "help") in the 'Advanced' tab of the page's settings.
You could then obtain a URL for the help page in a template like this::

	<a href="{% page_id_url "help" %}">help</a>
