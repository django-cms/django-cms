Contribution Guide
==================

Translators
-----------

For translators we have a `transifex account
<http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/django-cms/>`_ where you can translate
the .po files and don't need to install git or mercurial to be able to
contribute. All changes there will be automatically sent to the project.

Developers
----------

For contributing to django-cms follow these steps:

* You need either `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ or `Mercurial
  <http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/>`_ with the `hg-git
  <http://hg-git.github.com/>`_ extension installed.

* You need an account on `github <http://www.github.com/>`_.

* On github you can see all the `open tickets
  <http://github.com/divio/django-cms/issues>`_. Please be sure to check there
  first before you open a new one.

* Go to the `project-page <http://github.com/divio/django-cms/>`_ and click on
  the fork button. This creates your own repository of django-cms2 and enables
  you to push updates to this repository. On your fork you should see "Your
  Clone URL:". Copy the URL and clone it with git or hg-git.

::

	$ git clone YOURURL

or::

	$ hg gclone YOURURL

Make your changes and commit.
::

	$ git commit

or::

	$ hg commit

After you are finished you can push to github.
::

	$ git push origin

or::

	$ hg gpush origin

After you have done the push, your changes should show up in the `project
network <http://github.com/divio/django-cms/network>`_.

You can now press on "pull request" to send the project leaders a message of
what your changes contain and inform them that there are new changes ready to
be incorporated into the master tree.

After some time your local checkout and your github repository will probably
become out-of-sync with the official repository. To get the newest changesets,
add a new remote:
::

	$ git remote add upstream git://github.com/divio/django-cms.git

or::

	$ hg gremote add upstream git://github.com/divio/django-cms.git

After this you can do a fetch from upstream:
::

	$ git fetch upstream 	# only download
	$ git pull upstream master	# download and merge master branch

or::

	$ hg gfetch upstream 	# download
	$ hg update 		# merge

Now your repository is up-to-date again.

It is also good practice to use a branch for every bug / feature you commit if
you have more than one or you need more then one commit. This helps that we
can merge the whole branch and don't have to cherry-pick the single commits
that make up the fix / feature. Also it allows us to give you instructions if
something is missing (tests, docs) and you don't have to interfere with other
things you might be working on.

If you have questions you may wish to read some tutorials about git or
Mercurial or ask on IRC or the mailing list.
