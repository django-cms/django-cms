Navigation
==========

There are four template tags for use in the templates that are connected to the menu:
``show_menu``, ``show_menu_below_id``, ``show_sub_menu``, and ``show_breadcrumb``.

show_menu
---------

``{& show_menu %}`` renders the navigation of the current page.
You can overwrite the appearance and the HTML if you add a ``cms/menu.html``
template to your project or edit the one provided with django-cms.
``show_menu`` takes four optional parameters: ``start_level``, ``end_level``,
``extra_inactive``, and ``extra_active``.

The first two parameters, ``start_level`` (default=0) and ``end_level`` (default=100) specify from what level to which level
should the navigation be rendered.
If you have a home as a root node and don't want to display home you can render the navigation only after level 1.

The third parameter, ``extra_inactive`` (default=0), specifies how many levels of navigation should be displayed
if a node is not a direct ancestor or descendant of the current active node.

Finally, the fourth parameter, ``extra_active`` (default=100), specifies how many levels of
descendants of the currently active node should be displayed.

Some Examples:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complete navigation (as a nested list)::

	{% load cache cms_tags %}
	<ul>
		{% show_menu 0 100 100 100 %}
	</ul>

Navigation with active tree (as a nested list)::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu 0 100 0 100 %}
	</ul>

Navigation with only one active extra level::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu 0 100 0 1 %}
	</ul>

Level 1 navigation (as a nested list)::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu 1 %}
	</ul>

Navigation with a custom template::

	{% show_menu 0 100 100 100 "myapp/menu.html" %}

show_menu_below_id
------------------

If you have set an id in the advanced settings of a page, you can display the submenu of this page with
a template tag.  For example, we have a page called meta that is not displayed in the navigation and that
has the id "meta"::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu_below_id "meta" %}
	</ul>

You can give it the same optional parameters as ``show_menu``::

	<ul>
		{% show_menu_below_id "meta" 0 100 100 100 "myapp/menu.html" %}
	</ul>

show_sub_menu
-------------

Display the sub menu of the current page (as a nested list).
Takes one argument that specifies how many levels deep should the submenu be displayed.
The template can be found at ``cms/sub_menu.html``::

	<ul>
    	{% show_sub_menu 1 %}
	</ul>

Or with a custom template::

	<ul>
		{% show_sub_menu 1 "myapp/submenu.html" %}
	</ul>

show_breadcrumb
---------------

Show the breadcrumb navigation of the current page.
The template for the HTML can be found at ``cms/breadcrumb.html``.::

	{% show_breadcrumb %}

Or with a custom template::

	{% show_breadcrumb "myapp/breadcrumb.html" %}

If the current URL is not handled by the CMS or you are working in a navigation extender,
you may need to provide your own breadcrumb via the template.
This is mostly needed for pages like login, logout and third-party apps.


.. _extending_the_menu:

Extending the menu
------------------

The menu can be extended with static or dynamic content.
For example, you may have a shop with categories and want these categories to be displayed in the navigation.

Add the following to your ``settings.py`` file::

	CMS_NAVIGATION_EXTENDERS = (('shop.utils.get_nodes', gettext('Shop Categories')),)

Now you can link a navigation extender to a page in the 'Advanced' tab of the page settings.

An example of an extender function is in ``utils.py`` in ``myapp`` in the example project included in the source::

    from categories.models import Category
    
    def get_nodes(request):
        categories = list(Category.objects.all())
        res = [] # result list
        all_categories = categories[:]
        child_categories = [] # all categories with a parent

        # put all of the child categories in a list of their
        # own (children) and add all of the parent categories
        # (that is, categories with no parent) to the result list
        for category in categories:
            if category.parent_id:
                # this is a child category
                child_categories.append(category)
            else:
                # this is a parent category
                res.append(category)

        # now go through each parent category, putting its children
        # in a list called 'childrens' (because 'children' has already
        # been taken by mptt)
        for category in all_categories:
            category.childrens = []
            for child in children_categories:
                if child.parent_id == category.pk:
                    category.childrens.append(child)
        return res
    
The model would look something like this::

    from django.db import models
    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
    import mptt
    
    class Category(models.Model):
        parent = models.ForeignKey('self', blank=True, null=True)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=20)
     
        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.name
        
        def get_menu_title(self):
            return self.name
        
        def get_absolute_url(self):
            return reverse('category_view', args=[self.pk])
        
        try:
            mptt.register(Category)
        except mptt.AlreadyRegistered:
            pass

It is encouraged to use `django-mptt <http://code.google.com/p/django-mptt/>`_ (a
suitable version is included in the `mptt` directory) for the tree
structure because of performance considerations.
The objects provided must adhere to the following structure:

Each must have a ``get_menu_title`` function, a ``get_absolute_url`` function, and a
``childrens`` array with all of its children inside (the 's' at the end of ``childrens`` is done on purpose
because ``children`` is already taken by mptt).

Be sure that ``get_menu_title`` and ``get_absolute_url`` don't trigger any queries when called in a template or you 
may have some serious performance and DB problems with a lot of queries.

It may be wise to cache the output of ``get_nodes``. For this you may need to write a wrapper class because of
dynamic content that the pickle module can't handle. 

If you want to display some static pages in the navigation ("login", for example) you can write your own "dummy" class that adheres to the conventions described above.

A base class for this purpose can be found in ``cms/utils/navigation.py``

Properties of Navigation Nodes in templates
-------------------------------------------
::

	{{ node.is_leaf_node }}

Is it the last in the tree? If true it doesn't have any children.
(This normally comes from mptt.)
::

	{{ node.level }}

The level of the node. Starts at 0.
::

	{{ node.menu_level }}
	
The level of the node from the root node of the menu. Starts at 0.
If your menu starts at level 1 or you have a "soft root" (described
in the next section) the first node still would have 0 as its `menu_level`.
::

	{{ node.get_absolute_url }}

The absolute URL of the node.
::

	{{ node.get_title }}

The title in the current language of the node.
::

	{{ node.selected }}

If true this node is the current one selected/active at this URL.
::
 
	{{ node.ancestor }}

If true this node is an ancestor of the current selected node.
::

	{{ node.sibling }}

If true this node is a sibling of the current selected node.
::

	{{ node.descendant }}

If true this node is a descendant of the current selected node.
::

	{{ node.soft_root }}

If true this node is a "soft root".

Soft Roots
----------

"Soft roots" are pages that start a new navigation.
If you are in a child of a soft root node you can only see the path to the soft root.
This feature is useful if you have big navigation trees with a lot of pages and don't
want to overwhelm the user.

To enable it put the following in your ``settings.py`` file::

	CMS_SOFTROOT = True

Now you can mark a page as "soft root" in the 'Advanced' tab of the page's settings in the admin interface.

page_id_url
-----------

This template tag returns the URL of a page that has a symbolic name, known as
``id`` or  ``reverse_id``.  For example, you could have a help page that you want to display a link to 
on every page.  To do this, you would go to the help page in the admin interface and
enter a id (such as "help") in the 'Advanced' tab of the page's settings.
You could then obtain a URL for the help page in a template like this::

	<a href="{% page_id_url "help" %}">help</a>
