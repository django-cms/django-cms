Configuration
=============

Out of the box django-cms comes not with a lot features. But with some settings you can extend it to a enterprise ready solution.
All settings described here can be found in cms/settings.py or in the plugins folder if they have a settings.py

All thoose settings should be placed in your project settings.py

CMS_TEMPLATES 
--------------

A list of the templates you can select for a page.

Example::

	CMS_TEMPLATES = (
		('base.html', gettext('default')),
		('2col.html', gettext('2 Column')),
		('3col.html', gettext('3 Column')),
		('extra.html', gettext('Some extra fancy template')),
	)

CMS_TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE
------------------------

This is optional

Example::

    CMS_TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE = True

If this is enabled, pages have the additional template option
to inherit their template from the nearest ancestor. Adding new
pages defaults to this if the new page is not a root page.  

CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF
----------------------

Is used to configure the placeholders. 
This is optional.

Example::

	CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {
		'content': {
			'plugins': ('TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin'),
			'text_only_plugins': ('LinkPlugin',)
			'extra_context': {"width":640},
			'name':gettext("Content")
		},
		'right-column': {
			"plugins": ('TeaserPlugin', 'LinkPlugin'),
			"extra_context": {"width":280},
			'name':gettext("Right Column")
			'limits': {
				'global': 2,
				'TeaserPlugin': 1,
				'LinkPlugin': 1,
			},
    	},
    	'base.html content': {
    		"plugins": {'TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin', 'TeasePlugin'}
    	},
	}

You can combine template names and placeholder names to granually define the plugins like done with ''base.html content''.
	
**plugins**

A list of plugins that can be added to this placeholder. If not supplied all plugins can be selected.

**text_only_plugins**

A list of additional plugins that should only be available to the TextPlugin, but can't be added directly to this placeholder.

**extra_context**

Extra context that plugins in this placeholder receive.

**name**

The name displayed in admin. With the gettext stub it can be internationalized.

**limits**

Limit the number of plugins that can be placed inside this placeholder. 
Dictionary keys are plugin names; values their respective limits. 
Special case: "global" - Limit the absolute number of plugins in this 
placeholder regardless of their type (takes precedence over the type-specific
limits).


CMS_PERMISSION
--------------

Example::

	CMS_PERMISSION = True
	
If this is enabled you get 3 new models in Admin:

- Pages global permissions
- User groups - page
- Users - page

In the edit-view of the pages you can now assign users to pages and grant them permissions.
In the global permissions you can set the permissions for users globaly.

If a user has the right to create new users he can now do so in the "Users - page". But he will only see the users he created.
The users he created also can only have the rights he already has. So if he has only the right to edit a certain page all users he created also only can edit this page. 
Naturally he can even more limit the rights of the users he creates.


CMS_MODERATOR
--------------

Example::

	CMS_MODERATOR = True
	
If set to true gives you a new column "moderation" in the tree view.
You can select to moderate pages or hole trees. If a page is under moderation you will recieve an email if somebody changes a page and you will be asked to approve the changes. Only after you approved the changes they will be updated on the live site. If you change a page you moderate yourself you will need to approve it anyway. This allows you change a lot of pages for a new version of the site and can go live with all the changes on the same time.



CMS_SHOW_START_DATE & CMS_SHOW_END_DATE
----------------------------------------------

Example::

	CMS_SHOW_END_DATE = True
	CMS_SHOW_START_DATE = True
	
This adds 2 new date-time fields in the advanced-settings tab of the page.
With this option you can limit the time a page is published.

CMS_URL_OVERWRITE
-------------------

Example::

	CMS_URL_OVERWRITE = True
	
This adds a new field "url overwrite" in your in the advanced-settings tab of the page.
With this field you can overwrite the whole relative url of the page.


CMS_MENU_TITLE_OVERWRITE
---------------------------

Example::

	CMS_MENU_TITLE_OVERWRITE = True

This adds a new field "menu title" besides the title field.
With this field you can overwrite the title that is displayed in the menu.

To access the menu title in the template use::

	{{ page.get_menu_title }}

CMS_REDIRECTS
--------------

Example::

	CMS_REDIRECTS = True
	
This adds a new field "redirect" to the advanced-settings tab of the page
You can enter a url and if someone visits this page he gets redirected to this url.

Note: Don't use this too much. There is django.contrib.redirect for this purpose

CMS_SEO_FIELDS
----------------

Example::

	CMS_SEO_FIELDS = True

This adds a new Fieldset "SEO Fields" in the page admin. You can set there the Page Title, Meta Keywords and the Meta Description

To access the fields in the template use::
	
	{% load cms_tags %}
	<head>
		<title>{% page_attribute page_title %}</title>
		<meta name="description" content="{% page_attribute meta_description %}"/>
		<meta name="keywords" content="{% page_attribute meta_keywords %}"/>
		...
		...
	</head>


CMS_FLAT_URLS
---------------

Example::

	CMS_FLAT_URLS = True
	
If this is enabled the slugs are not nested in the urls.

So a page with slug "world" will have an url "/world" even it is a child of the page "hello"
If disabled the page would have an url: "/hello/world/"


CMS_NAVIGATION_EXTENDERS
------------------------

Example::

	CMS_NAVIGATION_EXTENDERS = (
		('shop.navigation.get_nodes', 'Shop Categories'),
		('gallery.navigation.get_nodes', 'Galleries'),
	)


Navigation extenders allow you to extend the menu. 
In Brief: A tuble with a python path to a function that returns a list of navigation nodes	
For detailed explanation read the navigation docs section :ref:`extending_the_menu`.

This gives you a new field in the advanced-settings tab of the page. You can there say that one navigation extender is attached to this page.

CMS_NAVIGATION_MODIFIERS
------------------------

Example::

	CMS_NAVIGATION_MODIFIERS = (
		('blog.navigation.add_blog_categories'),
	)
	
Navigation modifiers are functions in other apps that can modify the navigation. They can add, remove,
reorder navigation nodes. 

#TODO: more docs needed


CMS_APPLICATIONS_URLS
-----------------------


Example::

	CMS_APPLICATIONS_URLS = (
    	('someapp.urls', 'Some application'),
    	('sampleapp.urls_en', 'Sample application English URLs'),
    	('sampleapp.urls_de', 'Sample application German URLs'),
	)

You can let cms handle the urls of other 3th party apps and attach them to pages.
For example you have a page named blog and a blog application. You can attach the blog urls.py to the blog page. After this every url after blog page will be handled by the blog application. The nice thing about this is the cms can be used in the templates of the blog application. So you can use placeholders in the templates and they will be filled up with plugins that are defined in the blog page. Also the blog menu item will be selected if you are on a page that is handled by the blog application.

At the moment if you change this settings you should restart the server as there is a cache invalidation bug.

An simpler way is to have a page with the same url as the app. This will give you also the plugin and menu abilities but has some limitations when it comes to i18n and urls.

**ATTENTION**

All views must return RequestContext beside the normal Context 

CMS_UNIQUE_SLUGS
------------------

Example::

	CMS_UNIQUE_SLUGS = True
	
Defines if the slugs should be unique over all sites and languages.
This setting is changed automatically according to other settings.
Do not set it in you settings.py if you don't know what you are doing.

CMS_SOFTROOT 
-------------

Example::

	CMS_SOFTROOT = True
	
This adds a new field "softroot" to you advanced-settings tab in the page.
If a page is marked as softroot the menu will only display the items till the softroot. If you have a huge site you can partition the menu with this.

CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED
-----------------------

Example::

	CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED = False
	
By default django-cms hides the menu items that are not translated yet in the current language. With this setting set to False they will show up anyway.


CMS_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK
-----------------------

Example::

	CMS_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK = True
	
This will redirect the browser to the same page in an other language if the page is not available in the current language.

CMS_LANGUAGES
--------------

Which language should be used by the cms?

Example::

	CMS_LANGUAGES = (
	    ('fr', gettext('French')),
	    ('de', gettext('German')),
	    ('en', gettext('English')),
	)
	
Normally the cms takes the LANGUAGES from the settings.py. With this you can overwrite this. Be sure that you don't have more language in here than in the LANGUAGES setting.

CMS_CONTENT_CACHE_DURATION
--------------------------

Example::

	CMS_CONTENT_CACHE_DURATION = 60

Defines how long page content should be cached, including navigation and admin menu.

Default is 60

CMS_MEDIA_PATH
--------------

Example::
	
	CMS_MEDIA_PATH = "cms/"
	
The path from MEDIA_ROOT to the media files located in ``cms/media/``

default: ``cms/``

CMS_MEDIA_ROOT
--------------

Example::

	CMS_MEDIA_ROOT = "settings.MEDIA_ROOT + "/cms/"

The path to the media root of the cms media files.
 
Default: ``settings.MEDIA_ROOT + CMS_MEDIA_PATH``

CMS_MEDIA_URL
-------------

Example::

	CMS_MEDIA_URL = "/media/cms/"
	
The location of the media files that are located in cms/media/cms/

default: ``MEDIA_URL + CMS_MEDIA_PATH``

CMS_PAGE_MEDIA_PATH
-------------------

By default the cms creates a folder in called 'cms_page_media' in your static files folder where all uploaded media files are stored.
The media files are stored in subfolders numbered with the id of the page.

Example::

	CMS_PAGE_MEDIA_PATH = 'cms_page_media/'


CMS_DBGETTEXT
-------------

Enable gettext-based translation of CMS content rather than using the standard administration interface. Requires `django-dbgettext <http://http://bitbucket.org/drmeers/django-dbgettext>`_.

Default: ``False`` (unless ``dbgettext`` is in ``settings.INSTALLED_APPS``)

CMS_DBGETTEXT_SLUGS
-------------------

Enable gettext-based translation of page paths/slugs. Experimental at this stage as resulting translations cannot be guaranteed to be unique.

Default: ``False``

For general dbgettext settings, see the `dbgettext documentation <http://bitbucket.org/drmeers/django-dbgettext/src/tip/docs>`_.


CMS_PLUGIN_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
-----------------------------

A list of plugin context processors. Plugin context processors are callables that modify all plugin's context before rendering. See "Custom Plugins" for more information.


CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS
